# Cryptocurrencies

Accountability Accounting (AA, but better) is looking to get into the Cryptocurrency game by offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. Our client wants us to clustering algorithms in tandem with unsupervised learning to produce visualizations to argue for cryptocurrency.

What was accomplished was a creation of dataframes from cryptodata that removed null values, unnecessary columns, and more. Data was cleaned up so that cryptocurrencies could be properly visualized. Data Dimensions were reduced using PCA to create the principal components of cryptocurrency from the cryptodata. From this the data was visualized and a KMeans Model was created. New dataframes were made with the transformed data. 2-D and 3-D models were created to visualize findings and new tables were made to also visualize the final data findings.
